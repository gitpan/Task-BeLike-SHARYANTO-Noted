NAME
    Task::BeLike::SHARYANTO::Noted - Some modules which I take note of
    because I can never remember their names

VERSION
    version 0.03

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is a random list of modules which I need to take a
    note of because I can never seem to remember their names, usually
    because the name is not representative of what the module does, or the
    term is unusual, or both. Or it's just my failing memory.

    They are categorized by task.

TASK CONTENTS
  Prevent multiple instances of script from running simultaneously
    Similar to Proc::PID::File.

   Sys::RunAlone
  Automatically download, install, load CPAN modules upon first use
    Similar to Module::AutoLoad, Module::AutoINC.

   lib::xi
  Automatically load classes/modules upon first use
    Similar to Class::Autouse.

   L
FAQ
  Why don't you just favorite the modules in MetaCPAN?
    I reserve that for modules which I like/use and would like to be
    installed on my Perl installations.
